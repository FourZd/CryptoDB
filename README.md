# CryptoDB 

Creating a database of smart contracts
Planning to work with ETH, BNB, TRON, probably other chains.


‚úÖ ETH chain compatibility

‚úÖ BNB chain compatibility

‚úÖ SQLite3 connection

‚úÖ Multiprocessing

‚úÖ Automatic start from the last processed block

üîÑ Site creation

‚è≥ Transfer from SQLite3 to unified PostgreSQL DB

‚è≥ Move blockchains to another table, create ForeignKey

‚è≥ Merge eth.py and bnb.py ‚ö†Ô∏è DRY principle ‚ö†Ô∏è

‚è≥ TRON compatibility

‚è≥ Database with every single contract in crypto multichain world

‚è≥ 24/7 TX filter, so no transactions will be lost

‚è≥ TG Bot

‚è≥ Some useful features, f.e. users will be able to see if the contract author created something before (it will help investors to evage rugpulls)
