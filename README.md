# CryptoDB 

Creating a database of smart contracts
Planning to work with ETH, BNB, TRON, probably other chains.

⏳ Create a DB of proccessed blocks, so the app will start from the last completed block, not the LAST ATM.

⏳ Database with every single contract in crypto multichain world

⏳ 24/7 TX filter, so no transactions will be lost

⏳ TG Bot or other way for common users to get useful info

⏳ Some useful features, f.e. users will be able to see if the contract author created something before (it will help investors to evage rugpulls)
